                <p>
                    <strong>Recommender Systems (RS)</strong> influence everyday decisions, yet most remain optimized
                    for short-term engagement or commercial gain.
                    <strong> RS4SD: Workshop on Recommender Systems for Sustainable Development</strong> using responsible nudging aims to reorient this focus by exploring how RS can promote sustainable
                    development through behavioral change and nudging strategies.

                    </a>
                    , RS4SD will highlight RS applications that encourage responsible consumption, sustainable mobility,
                    healthy eating, and digital well-being.
                    Particularly, we focus on how AI and RS can be designed to promote sustainable behaviors through
                    multi-objective/criteria optimization and ethically aligned interventions.

                    A central theme is the integration of behavioral science and AI to design interventions that guide
                    users toward more sustainable and healthier choicesâ€”without compromising autonomy.
                    RS4SD brings together researchers and practitioners from RS, AI, sustainability, and behavioral
                    science to share models, datasets, frameworks, and real-world use cases.
                    The workshop encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and aims to build a community dedicated to
                    responsible, behavior-aware RS that benefit both individuals and society.

                <p>
                    The goal of <strong>RS4SD</strong> is to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and advance the
                    development of responsible recommender systems
                    that support the Sustainable Development Agenda, public health, and positive behavior change.
                    The workshop emphasizes behavior-aware and ethically aligned AI systems that optimize for multiple
                    objectives beyond user satisfaction alone. It seeks to:

                <ul className="custom-list">
                    <li>Bring together researchers and practitioners from RS, behavioral science, sustainability,
                        health, and AI ethics
                    </li>
                    <li>Explore how behavioral nudging and AI-driven interventions can drive meaningful changes in user
                        behavior without compromising autonomy

                    <li>Discuss state-of-the-art techniques in multi-objective RS and user-centric AI</li>
                    <li>
                        Introduce novel metrics and benchmarks for evaluating impact beyond engagement, including
                        behavioral effectiveness and societal value

                    Expected outcomes include a curated selection of peer-reviewed papers, an expert panel discussion,
                    and the launch of collaborative initiatives.
                    To support long-term impact, we plan to create a mailing list, share workshop highlights, explore a
                    special journal issue,
                    and promote shared benchmarks and datasets to foster ongoing collaboration.
